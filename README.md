# DCF_SHINY_APP
Compute Intrinsic Value

The actual app is in app.R, very simple and intuitive, very useful in a pinch and fun to build. 
To use it access the web address at 	https://hhcshinyholder.shinyapps.io/DCF_SHINY_APP2/  and follow the directions

NOTE 3-12-2020: Unfortuanely, do to the closing of the financial data API this app drew upon, the app can no longer function, and a similar replacement has not yet been identified at this time.
